# Wordle

This is a custom Wordle variant built with a meaningful twist. Instead of guessing random dictionary terms, every puzzle challenges you to uncover a five-letter word tied to real-world social, environmental, or mental health issues. The core mechanics deliver the classic word-guessing experience you expect, but with an engaging educational layer baked in. Once a game concludes—whether you crack the puzzle or run out of attempts—you unlock a thought-provoking fact or statistic related to that specific issue. It provides a familiar daily challenge while sparking awareness about topics that genuinely matter.
